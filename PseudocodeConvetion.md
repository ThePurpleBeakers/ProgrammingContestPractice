# Pseudocode Convention

Pseudocode is not a real programming language. Rather it is a notation which allows us to quickly write out code 
to be implemented in a real programming language (i.e java). Having an agreed upon set of notation allow us to understand 
each other's quick-hand code which allows us to express code faster and come up with solutions faster . 
Any ideas on changes is gladly accepted.

## If Statements


**Java Code**

```
if( 2 > 3)
{
  //do somethhing
}
```

**Pseudocode**

```
if 2 > 3:
  #do something
```

**Java Code**

```
if( isCool() && notCool() )
{
  //do somethhing
}
```

**Pseudocode**

```
if isCool and notCool():
  #do something
```

## Variables

**Java Code**


```
String name = "Bob";
int age = 12;
double pay = 2.00;
Car ford = null:
```

**Pseudocode**

```
var name = "Bob"
var age = 12;
var pay = 2.00
var ford = null
```


## For Loops


**Java Code**
```
for( int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
  //do somethhing
}
```

**Pseudocode**
```
for i is 0 to 9:
  #do something
```
