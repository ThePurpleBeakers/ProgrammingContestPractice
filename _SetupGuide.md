## Setting Up Github

Github is a website where we will be able to post code online and share it with each other. Its gonna be good because we can post the longer pieces of code we write for the practice problems. You will need a Github account. We will also be using the Github account for Gitter. Gitter will be talked about later in the article.

#### Github Account

1) Go to this link: https://github.com/join?source=header-home
2) Fill in the required information
3) Verify you Github account by checking your email.


## Setting Up Gitter

Gitter will be our main chat. It is good because it is quick and we can send snippets of code. Its really easy to use and very nice. 

This is what it looks like.

1) Once you your Github account created go to https://gitter.im/ and sign in using your Github account. You will need to allow Gitter to use your Github account so allow it when it asks you to.

2) Then go to https://gitter.im/WSFCSCareerCenterCoders/Lounge and type "Hi" in the chat. 

3) I will add you to the WSFCSCareerCenterCoders community
