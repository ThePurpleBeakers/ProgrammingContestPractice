# !tooShabby() Strategy

## Problem Reading and Problem Diffulty Ranking 

- How long should it take us to read a through the problems the first time?

1 min 20 secs per problem for skimming. 6 mins skimming through all the problems.

- How should we rank the difficulty of problems?

- What do we use to determine how hard or easy problem is?

Looking at how hard or easy the inputs and outputs look.

- What scale should we use to determine difficulty (Hard, Medium, Easy Levels or Estimated Time or or 1-5 Diffulty Scale or etc.)
- How long should it take us to really read one problem?
- How should we read a problem?

## Problem Solving Process

- How do we understand a problem? What parts of the problem do we need to understand? How do we know when we understand the project?

understand how to read the input in.
Know what the input is saying.
Understand what the output is.
During evaluating time take time to try to understand what could be used to finish the project.

- What should we do when we don't understand a problem?

Skip it.

- What are some helpful strategies to make the problem easier? (Break it down into small parts)

Break it down.
Look at what you can make into a method and make sure it is useful. (Repetitive code)

- What questions should we be asking ourselves when solving problems?

- How long should it take to solve a problem? (Come up with a solution and write it down not code it)

5 mins minimum and 10 minutes maximum

- How many people should be solving one problem? 

one person for easy problem
maybe two person for hard problems.

## Execution Strategy

- How do we distribute work between programming and solving problems?

Decide on the spot.
If you dont feel confident dont do it.

- What is the overall strategy?

All of coding and all of us solving problems.

- When should we work alone and when should we work together?

Every 5 mins do a check up.

## Implementation Strategies and Techniques

- What are techniques that will make implementing/programming a solution faster/easier? ( pseudocode? list of general ideas?)
- What is the procedure for when we get stuck?
- What is the procedire for when we need help?
