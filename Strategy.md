# !tooShabby() Strategy

## Problem Reading and Problem Diffulty Ranking 

- How long should it take us to read a through the problems the first time?
- How should we rank the difficulty of problems?
- What do we use to determine how hard or easy problem is?
- What scale should we use to determine difficulty (Hard, Medium, Easy Levels or Estimated Time or or 1-5 Diffulty Scale or etc.)
- How long should it take us to really read one problem?
- How should we read a problem?

## Problem Solving Process

- How do we understand a problem? What parts of the problem do we need to understand? How do we know when we understand the project?
- What should we do when we don't understand a problem?
- What are some helpful strategies to make the problem easier? (Break it down into small parts)
- What questions should we be asking ourselves when solving problems?
- How long should it take to solve a problem? (Come up with a solution and write it down not code it)
- How many people should be solving one problem? 

## Execution Strategy

- How do we distribute work between programming and solving problems?
- What is the overall strategy?
- When should we work alone and when should we work together?

## Implementation Strategies and Techniques

- What are techniques that will make implementing/programming a solution faster/easier? ( pseudocode? list of general ideas?)
- What is the procedure for when we get stuck?
- What is the procedire for when we need help?
